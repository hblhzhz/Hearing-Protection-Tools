The sound that humans perceive through hearing can range from 20HZ to 20kHZ, from 0dB HL to 130dB HL. When the sound reaches or exceeds 130 dB HL, people may feel earache and discomfort. Based on the frequency of sound and the ability of people to perceive sound intensity, the World Health Organization has developed a grading standard for hearing impairment. It is recommended that the hearing impairment be divided into four levels based on the average pure tone threshold of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. 26\~40dB HL is mild, 41\~60dB HL is moderate, and 61~80dB HL is severe. Greater than or equal to 81dB HL is extremely heavy.
